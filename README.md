# Cryptopals Crypto Challenges

This repository contains programs written in [Go](https://golang.org)
to solve the [Crytopals Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com).

## Package Structure

The project is divided into sets containing challenges containing a descriptive
package name for the implementation of the solution. For example, the solution
to challenge 1 is in the package
`github.com/eseymour/cryptopals/set1/challenge01/hexToBase64`. The progress
section also lists the name of the relevant package within the
`github.com/eseymour/cryptopals/set#/challenge##` package.
